                <p>This was best hotel I visited during my visit to Darjeeling.

                    Good food.
                    
                    Good hospitality. Good ambiance.
                    
                    Nice view from room. Good working room heaters.
                    
                    Buffet breakfast and buffet dinner. I will strongly recommend it.</p>

                <h2>Refreshment</h2>
                <p>Most hoteliers are aware of this in a general sense, but it is the execution where we often stumble. The expected welcome refreshment is a bottle of wine, a small cheese tray, a fruit place, crackers, cookies or any combination of the five. Nowadays, though, you must look beyond the perfunctory and truly own this aspect of the guest experience if you are to make a lasting impression.</p>

                <p>Especially in the current hospitality landscape, one that is slowly recovering from a significant hit, engaging with guests is prone to be more important than ever before. Keep in mind that post COVID-19 travelers are very likely to display a more cautious behavior and to have different requirements from their hotel experience.</p>

                <h2>Room Security</h2>
                <p>Security doesnâ€™t end with physical safety: Hotels have become a prime target for cyberattacks. According to a report by PwC, the hospitality industry has the second-highest number of cybersecurity breaches, with most of the prominent hotels in the industry having fallen victim to breaches.
